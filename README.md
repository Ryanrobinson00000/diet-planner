# diet-planner

This program is a diet planning/cataloguing program built in Java.  The purpose of this program is to increase health of its users by bringing attention to the calories that we take in each day, among other dietary substances.  The program currently catalogues calories, but code could also be modified slightly to allow for documentation of substances like sodium, fat, sugars, or other substances of interest.

# installation
This program can be installed by downloading the code.  If there is an issue with the JDatePicker when attempting to run, the JDatePicker jar file must be manually added.

# usage
In order to operate the program a profile must be active.  If there isn't a profile must be made.  Additional profiles can be added and information will not overlap between profiles.  A profile must be selected in order to log in.  Once a user logs in they can either view previous records or enter a new record for a specified date.  In order to add a new record, the user must choose a date from the calandar.  Once the record is entered, meals can be added for that specific day by adding rows to the table, followed by pressing "add meal".  A meal can be remove by clicking the desired row, followed by pressing "remove meal".  The info is saved by pressing "save".
